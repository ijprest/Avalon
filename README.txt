Avalon is a skin for Mediaportal

We have been designing and developing for about one year on a 1920x1080 skin that will offer a clean and simple layout without compromising the ever growing need for information at a glance. You will have the choice between several layouts to suit your needs. All configurable from within MP.
(A special thanks to the StreamedMP Team for sharing their code and inspiration)
As you all know from "Maya" we hold on to the concept of making all screens as consistent as possible 
for a better user interface experience. (should also enhance the WAF)
